# Provenance records: what a run was told to do, and what has to be cited for the
# methods it actually ran.
#
# The writer lives here because every command line tool of the family is built
# on this package, and so are the references for the methods this package and
# ROMEO implement. Packages above it register their own at load time through
# `register_citation!` and `register_version!`: CLEARSWI adds CLEAR-SWI, and so
# on. A package below it, which cannot reach the registry, is registered by the
# extension that binds it (TGV QSM). That keeps one definition per reference
# while the dependency arrows all point the same way.

"""
    CITATIONS

Reference text for the methods in the toolbox, keyed by method. This package
seeds it with its own and ROMEO's; other packages add theirs through
[`register_citation!`](@ref).
"""
const CITATIONS = Dict{Symbol,String}()

"""
    NOTICES

Non-citation facts a method carries, keyed like [`CITATIONS`](@ref). Written into
the citations file when that method ran, because that file is what someone reads
before publishing or before shipping a product.
"""
const NOTICES = Dict{Symbol,String}()

"""
    LABELS

Human-readable method name for each key, used as the heading above its reference
in the citations file. A reader should be able to tell which step of the run each
reference is for without recognising the paper.
"""

"""
    register_citation!(key, text; notice=nothing, label=nothing)

Register the reference for a method, to be written by [`write_provenance`](@ref)
when that method is used. Call this from a package's `__init__` for the methods
that package implements, so the text lives with the code rather than in whichever
tool happens to print it.

`label` is the method name shown as a heading above the reference, so a reader
can see which step of the run it belongs to. Two keys may share a label, in which
case their references appear together under one heading - which is how a method
with more than one reference is expressed. Defaults to the key.

Re-registering the same key with identical text is a no-op; changing the text of
an existing key warns, because two packages disagreeing about a reference is a
bug worth hearing about.

Write `settings_<tool>.txt` and `citations_<tool>.txt` into `dir`, recording what
was run and what has to be cited for it.

* `version` the application version string.
* `args` the raw command line arguments.
* `settings` any key-value collection of resolved settings. Written sorted, and
  array values are written out rather than skipped, so the echo times actually
  used are recoverable from the record.
* `cite` the methods that were actually used, as keys of [`CITATIONS`](@ref).
  Pass only what ran: a citation for a method the user did not use is as wrong as
  a missing one. Any [`NOTICES`](@ref) entry for those methods is included too.
* `optional` further methods to list under "Optional citations".
* `inputs` `name => path` pairs for the input files.
* `packages` modules whose versions did the work, recorded alongside the Julia
  version so a result can be traced to the code that produced it.
* `describe` how to render an input path. Defaults to the absolute path; callers
  that can read the file cheaply pass something that adds the dimensions.
